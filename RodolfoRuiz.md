### **Early Technical Foundation**

Rodolfo began his career in the 1990s as a **software engineer at Softtek**, delivering enterprise software for **General Electric Aircraft Engines** in the United States. He quickly assumed leadership responsibilities, managing a 12-person offshore development team and establishing processes that became templates for future GE-Softtek collaborations.

From there, he advanced to **CGI** in Ohio, leading the development of **natural-language-processing libraries for Pfizer Canada**, where he built tokenization, parsing, and classification modules in Java for the automated analysis of biomedical literature—an early precursor to modern text-analytics pipelines. These projects required an understanding of computational linguistics, algorithmic optimization, and large-scale data handling before “AI” became an industry term.

At **SigmaTao Software Factory**, he served as **Software Architect** for **Telmex**, Mexico’s national telecommunications company. He designed and implemented signaling and messaging systems capable of supporting millions of concurrent users. His leadership in architecture and quality assurance contributed to SigmaTao’s CMMi certification, and the patterns he established became internal development standards.

By the time he joined **H-E-B** in San Antonio as **Project Leader, Shopping Experience**, Rodolfo had evolved from engineer to systems architect. He led cross-functional projects improving retail point-of-sale performance and resource-planning workflows. The libraries and automation tools he introduced measurably reduced transaction times and provided the foundation for data-driven retail operations.

### **Entrepreneurial Emergence and Consulting Phase**

In 2005, Rodolfo founded **Presencia Móvil** and later **Cuponcel**, two ventures that anticipated mobile marketing and customer engagement long before smartphones became mainstream. He built CRM and SMS/MMS marketing platforms connecting brands and consumers in real time, scaling both companies to profitability and executing successful exits by 2011.

He subsequently joined **Iron Mountain Mexico** as **Corporate IT Manager**, where he managed a 20-person team overseeing national IT operations. He implemented SAP-connected automation systems that reduced operational costs by 35 percent and established vendor governance and budget control frameworks aligned with corporate compliance. This role marked his first large-scale P&L and people-management responsibility within a global enterprise.

Between 2017 and 2021, as a **consultant in emerging technology integration**, Rodolfo applied his combined business and technical expertise to industrial and logistics clients. He led ERP modernization and IoT-driven analytics initiatives, designed architectures linking warehouse automation to SAP data flows, and implemented predictive-maintenance systems combining IoT telemetry with AI modeling. His consulting engagements covered the full lifecycle: pre-sales, requirements definition, implementation, and long-term operations support. This period consolidated his identity as a **technologist fluent in executive language**—able to translate complex architectures into measurable business outcomes.

### **Driblet Labs – From Prototype to Exit**

Rodolfo’s most transformative chapter came with **Driblet Labs, Inc.**, founded in 2013 from a prototype built in Monterrey. He relocated the company to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and turned it into an **industrial IoT startup specializing in real-time water and energy intelligence**.

He and his team developed a **hardware-software platform integrating embedded sensors, microcontrollers, and cloud analytics** capable of tracking fluid consumption at industrial scale. The system’s architecture combined custom energy-harvesting circuits, low-power wireless telemetry, and containerized data pipelines connected to **SAP HANA** for enterprise reporting.

Under Rodolfo’s leadership, Driblet secured angel and venture investment, participated in **AngelHack (global winner, 2013)**, and joined **gener8tor Madison’s 2014 accelerator cohort**. The company exhibited at **TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco** and **CES 2014**, receiving attention for bridging environmental sustainability and industrial analytics.

He managed a **multi-million-dollar R&D budget**, built a **15-member cross-functional team**, and negotiated commercial pilots with utilities and manufacturing firms that converted into recurring enterprise contracts. Driblet’s patented smart-water-management system was eventually **acquired by an international industrial group**, generating a strong return for investors and validating the company’s technology. This exit demonstrated Rodolfo’s full-spectrum leadership: ideation, fundraising, team building, productization, market development, and M&A execution.

### **Hertzian Labs and Quantum-Safe Innovation**

In 2021, Rodolfo co-founded **Hertzian Labs** in Tallinn, Estonia, expanding into cybersecurity and post-quantum cryptography. He directed operations, finance, and business development for a distributed team working on FPGA-based co-processors designed to bring quantum-resistant encryption to enterprise and cloud systems.

He managed a **USD 1.5 million annual budget** and built partnerships across Europe and Latin America. Hertzian integrated advanced lattice-based cryptographic primitives into ERP and cloud infrastructures—positioning the firm within a niche yet critical segment of cybersecurity R&D. The company maintained double-digit annual growth and established a global reputation for technical rigor and innovation.

This period reinforced Rodolfo’s capacity to **operate at the frontier of deep-tech commercialization**: transforming academic research into deployable enterprise solutions while balancing research cadence, market timing, and profitability.

### **Advisory and Current Focus**

Since 2025, Rodolfo has served as an **independent consultant in digital transformation and ERP strategy**, advising large manufacturers and service organizations on aligning automation, data analytics, and AI systems with business outcomes. He continues to develop **Neosmia**, an applied-AI venture focused on olfactory sensing for industrial and health applications, where he explores the intersection of physical sensing and machine intelligence.

His current consulting and venture work draw on his experience with **enterprise architecture, IoT systems design, AI integration, and organizational leadership**, helping corporations modernize technology stacks and reimagine data-driven operations.

### **Leadership, Approach, and Expertise**

Rodolfo’s leadership style is analytical, metrics-oriented, and cross-disciplinary. He moves fluidly between boardroom and lab, able to discuss financial models, system architecture, or product-market strategy with equal precision. He has managed distributed teams across five countries, coordinated complex R&D initiatives, and maintained consistent profitability across his ventures.

Technically, his expertise spans **embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, data analytics, and cybersecurity**, with practical experience in **C/C++, Python, Java, FPGA design, MQTT, REST, and AI model integration**. Commercially, he has owned full P&L responsibility, driven multimillion-dollar revenue targets, negotiated enterprise contracts, and overseen successful fundraising and exit events.
